## classify_data_jobs
### project team members: Charis Chan, Joyce Ching, and Inderpal Kaur

Our goal was ultimately to see if we can create a model that does a good job classifying the 3 job types (data analyst, data engineer, and data scientist). 
We were less focused on model accuracy and more so on interpretability. We wanted to find out what features distinguish between the classes and see if those features change our understanding of what each job requires, how to prepare, etc.
